# We've placed the docker-compose.yaml under docker/ so that the generically named
# hooks/ directory doesn't pollute the main directory.  Because we need to
# COPY the source into the container, we need to use some -f gymnastics to
# ensure that "COPY . /src" is referring to the repo root, not the directory
# that contains the docker-compose.yaml.
# This script gets executed with a pwd of wherever the docker-compose.yaml is.
